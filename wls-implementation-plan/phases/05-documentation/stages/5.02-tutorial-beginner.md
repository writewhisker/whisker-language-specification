# Stage 5.02: Beginner Tutorials

## Objective
Create beginner tutorial series (5 tutorials).

## Files to Create
- `docs/tutorials/beginner/01-first-story.md`
- `docs/tutorials/beginner/02-adding-choices.md`
- `docs/tutorials/beginner/03-using-variables.md`
- `docs/tutorials/beginner/04-conditional-content.md`
- `docs/tutorials/beginner/05-linking-passages.md`

## Prompt

```
Create beginner tutorials:

1. docs/tutorials/beginner/01-first-story.md:

# Your First Whisker Story

## What You'll Learn
- Creating a story file
- Writing your first passage
- Running your story

## Prerequisites
- Whisker installed (see Installation Guide)

## Step 1: Create a Story File

Create a new file called `hello.ws`:

```whisker
:: Start
Welcome to your first Whisker story!

This is simple text that will be displayed to the reader.
```

## Step 2: Run Your Story

```bash
whisker play hello.ws
```

## Understanding the Code

- `:: Start` - This declares a passage named "Start"
- The text below is the passage content
- Every story needs a "Start" passage

## Try It Yourself

Create a passage that:
- Has a different greeting
- Includes multiple paragraphs

## Next Steps
- [Adding Choices](./02-adding-choices.md)

---

2. Create similar tutorials for:
- Adding choices (+ syntax, -> targets)
- Using variables ($var, {do})
- Conditional content ({if}, {else})
- Linking passages (multiple passages, links)

Each tutorial should:
- Be 100-150 lines
- Have clear learning objectives
- Include runnable examples
- Have exercises
- Link to next tutorial
```

## Expected Output
~600 lines across 5 tutorial files.

## Verification
```bash
ls docs/tutorials/beginner/
# Should show 5 .md files
```

## Next Stage
