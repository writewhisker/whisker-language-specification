# Stage 5.03: Intermediate Tutorials

## Objective
Create intermediate tutorial series (5 tutorials).

## Files to Create
- `docs/tutorials/intermediate/01-advanced-flow.md`
- `docs/tutorials/intermediate/02-data-structures.md`
- `docs/tutorials/intermediate/03-functions.md`
- `docs/tutorials/intermediate/04-styling.md`
- `docs/tutorials/intermediate/05-media.md`

## Prompt

```
Create intermediate tutorials:

1. docs/tutorials/intermediate/01-advanced-flow.md:

# Advanced Flow Control

## What You'll Learn
- Gather points for converging paths
- Tunnels for reusable passages
- Inline conditionals
- Once-only content

## Prerequisites
- Completed beginner tutorials

## Gather Points

Gather points collect divergent choice paths:

```whisker
:: Conversation
What would you like to discuss?
+ [The weather]
  "Nice weather today."
+ [The news]
  "Did you see the headlines?"
+ [Nothing]
  You remain silent.
-
"Anyway, I should get going."
+ [Goodbye] -> END
```

## Tunnels

Tunnels let you call a passage and return:

```whisker
:: Main
Before the aside.
-> Aside ->
After the aside.

:: Aside
(This is a brief tangent.)
->->
```

[Continue with inline conditionals, once-only]

---

2. Create tutorials for:
- Data structures (LIST, ARRAY, MAP)
- Functions and namespaces
- Styling stories (themes, CSS)
- Adding media (images, audio)

Each tutorial:
- 150-200 lines
- Builds on previous knowledge
- Practical examples
- Common patterns
```

## Expected Output
~800 lines across 5 tutorial files.

## Verification
```bash
ls docs/tutorials/intermediate/
```
