# Stage 2.01: Specification - Gather Points

## Objective
Add gather point syntax and semantics to the flow control specification.

## Files to Modify
- `phase-1-specification/spec/02-FLOW-CONTROL.md`

## Prompt

```
Update the flow control specification at:
/Users/jims/code/github.com/whisker-language-specification-1.0/phase-1-specification/spec/02-FLOW-CONTROL.md

Add a new section for Gather Points after the existing choice documentation:

## Gather Points

Gather points collect divergent choice paths back to a single point.

### Syntax

A gather point is a line starting with `-` at the same indentation as choices:

```whisker
:: Conversation
+ [Ask about weather]
  "Nice weather we're having."
+ [Ask about news]
  "Did you hear about the festival?"
+ [Stay silent]
  The silence stretches awkwardly.
-
The conversation continues.
```

### Semantics

1. After any choice is selected and its content displayed, execution continues at the next gather point at the same or lower indentation level.

2. Content after the gather point `-` is displayed for all paths.

3. Gather points can be nested to match nested choices:

```whisker
:: Investigation
+ [Search desk]
  ++ [Open drawer]
     You find a key.
  ++ [Check papers]
     Just bills.
  --
  The desk reveals its secrets.
+ [Search closet]
  Mostly clothes.
-
You've finished searching.
```

### Rules

- Gather must be at same indentation as the choices it collects
- A gather collects all choices at its level and above
- Nested gathers (`--`, `---`) collect nested choices
- Content after gather is always executed after any choice at that level

### Edge Cases

- Empty gather (just `-`) is valid - continues to next content
- Gather with no preceding choices is ignored
- Gather can have content on same line: `- The story continues.`

Include 3-4 complete examples showing:
1. Simple gather after choices
2. Nested gathers
3. Multiple gathers in sequence
4. Gather with inline content
```

## Expected Output
~150 lines added to specification.

## Verification
```bash
grep -c "gather" phase-1-specification/spec/02-FLOW-CONTROL.md
# Expected: 20+
```

## Next Stage
