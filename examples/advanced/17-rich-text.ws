Here's an unordered list:
- Rusty sword

## More Formatting Examples

You can combine formatting: **this is bold with *nested italic* inside**.

Here's a blockquote with multiple paragraphs:

> This is the first paragraph of the quote.
>
> This is the second paragraph of the quote.

And here's ~~strikethrough text~~ for deleted content.
